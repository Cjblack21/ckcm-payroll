# Leave System - Comprehensive Audit Report

## ✅ VERIFIED WORKING FEATURES

### 1. Leave Request Submission (Personnel)
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

**Flow**:
```
Personnel → Request Leave Form
    ↓
Validation: dates, reason, past date check
    ↓
POST /api/personnel/leaves
    ↓
Creates LeaveRequest (status: PENDING)
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Date validation (no past dates)
- ✅ Philippines timezone handling
- ✅ Days calculation
- ✅ Paid/Unpaid selection
- ✅ Leave type selection (VACATION, SICK, etc.)
- ✅ Reason required

**Code**: `src/app/personnel/leaves/page.tsx` (lines 114-178)

---

### 2. Admin Approval Workflow
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

**Flow**:
```
Admin → View Pending Leaves
    ↓
Approve/Deny with optional comment
    ↓
PATCH /api/admin/leave-requests/[id]
    ↓
IF APPROVED:
  → Update status to APPROVED
  → Create ON_LEAVE attendance records (all days)
  → Log success
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Creates attendance records for every day in leave period
- ✅ Handles existing attendance records (updates to ON_LEAVE)
- ✅ Includes weekends in attendance records
- ✅ Continues on error (doesn't fail entire approval)
- ✅ Stores admin comment

**Code**: `src/app/api/admin/leave-requests/[id]/route.ts` (lines 52-119)

---

### 3. Attendance Blocking
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

**Flow**:
```
Employee → Punch In/Out (attendance portal)
    ↓
Check approved leaves for today
    ↓
IF ON LEAVE:
  → Block with error message
  → Show leave dates
  → Return 403 Forbidden
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Blocks time-in and time-out
- ✅ Works for paid and unpaid leaves
- ✅ Shows leave details in error
- ✅ Date range check: startDate <= today <= endDate

**Code**: `src/app/api/attendance/punch/route.ts` (lines 40-106)

---

### 4. Payroll Integration
**Status**: ✅ WORKING (Fixed - No Double Deduction)

**Flow**:
```
Generate Payroll
    ↓
For each user:
  → Query approved unpaid leaves in period
  → Count working days (exclude Sundays)
  → Calculate: days × dailySalary
  → Add to totalDeductions
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Only deducts unpaid leaves (isPaid: false)
- ✅ Pro-rates across payroll periods
- ✅ Excludes Sundays from count
- ✅ Shows separately in breakdown
- ✅ NO DOUBLE DEDUCTION (fixed)

**Code**: `src/lib/actions/payroll.ts` (lines 843-914)

## ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: `requestType` Field Unused
**Severity**: 🟡 Low

**Problem**:
- Frontend sends `requestType: "LEAVE" | "TRAVEL_ORDER"`
- Backend ignores it (doesn't save to database)
- Field not in Prisma schema

**Location**: 
- `src/app/personnel/leaves/page.tsx` (line 151)
- `src/app/api/personnel/leaves/route.ts` (doesn't use it)

**Impact**: None currently (feature not utilized)

**Fix**: Either:
1. Add `requestType` to schema and use it
2. Remove from frontend (keep only `type`)

---

### Issue 2: `customLeaveType` Field Unused
**Severity**: 🟡 Low

**Problem**:
- Backend validates `customLeaveType` for type="CUSTOM"
- Frontend never sends type="CUSTOM"
- Schema has field but it's never populated

**Location**:
- `src/app/api/personnel/leaves/route.ts` (lines 51-56, 74)

**Impact**: None (feature not exposed in UI)

**Fix**: Either:
1. Add "Custom" option in frontend dropdown
2. Remove validation from backend

---

### Issue 3: Date String Format Inconsistency
**Severity**: 🟢 Very Low

**Problem**:
- Attendance records created with: `new Date(dateString + 'T00:00:00.000Z')`
- This creates UTC date, but `toPhilippinesDateString()` returns local date string
- Potential timezone mismatch

**Location**:
- `src/app/api/admin/leave-requests/[id]/route.ts` (line 71)

**Impact**: Likely none (dates match in practice)

**Recommendation**: Use consistent timezone handling

---

### Issue 4: No Overlap Detection
**Severity**: 🟡 Low

**Problem**:
- User can submit multiple overlapping leave requests
- No validation prevents: Jan 10-15 + Jan 12-20

**Impact**: Admin confusion, potential double-counting

**Recommendation**: Add overlap detection in submission

---

### Issue 5: No Leave Balance Tracking
**Severity**: 🟡 Low (Feature Gap)

**Problem**:
- System doesn't track leave balance per user
- No limit on leave days per year
- Can request unlimited paid leave

**Impact**: Business logic issue

**Recommendation**: Add leave balance system if needed

---

### Issue 6: Past Leave Approval
**Severity**: 🟢 Very Low

**Problem**:
- Admin can approve leaves with past dates
- Creates attendance records for past dates
- May conflict with existing attendance

**Location**:
- `src/app/api/admin/leave-requests/[id]/route.ts` (no date validation)

**Impact**: Low (admin responsibility)

**Recommendation**: Warn admin if approving past leave

---

## ✅ EDGE CASES HANDLED CORRECTLY

### 1. Existing Attendance Records
✅ Updates existing records to ON_LEAVE instead of failing

### 2. Partial Approval Failure
✅ Continues creating other attendance records if one fails

### 3. Weekend Handling
✅ Creates attendance records for weekends (correct for blocking)

### 4. Multi-Period Leaves
✅ Payroll correctly pro-rates across different periods

### 5. Leave Deletion
✅ Personnel can only delete PENDING leaves
✅ Admin can delete any leave

---
