# Attendance Reset Fix - Complete Makeover

## Problem Identified
When resetting attendance data from `admin/profile?tab=settings`, the attendance records were deleted but **deductions remained visible** in the attendance view because:

1. The reset route only deleted attendance records
2. Associated deductions (Late Arrival, Early Timeout, Absence) were NOT deleted
3. These orphaned deductions would still appear in the system

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Reset Attendance Route** (`/api/admin/reset/attendance`)
Updated the route to perform a complete cleanup:

```typescript
// Step 1: Delete all attendance-related deductions
- Finds all deduction types: Late Arrival, Early Timeout, Absence
- Deletes all deductions associated with these types

// Step 2: Delete all attendance records
- Deletes all attendance records

// Returns detailed count of what was deleted
{
  attendance: count,
  deductions: count
}
```

### 2. **Updated Profile Settings Page**
Enhanced the reset confirmation to show detailed feedback:
- Shows exactly how many attendance records were deleted
- Shows exactly how many deductions were deleted
- Example: "Attendance reset complete! Deleted 50 attendance records and 12 related deductions."

### 3. **Fixed Timezone Issue in Late Deduction Calculation**
Also fixed a critical bug in `/api/attendance/punch/route.ts`:
- The late deduction calculation was mixing timezones
- Philippines time was being compared incorrectly with server time
- This caused incorrect late minute calculations (e.g., 2845 minutes instead of actual minutes)

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Properly extract Philippines timezone components
const phTimeString = now.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'Asia/Manila' })
const phDate = new Date(phTimeString)
// Then use these components to create expected time
```

## How It Works Now

### Reset Process
1. User clicks "Reset Attendance" in Profile Settings
2. System prompts for password confirmation
3. On confirmation:
   - Deletes all Late Arrival deductions
   - Deletes all Early Timeout deductions  
   - Deletes all Absence deductions
   - Deletes all attendance records
4. Shows detailed success message with counts

### Attendance View After Reset
- All attendance records: **CLEARED**
- All deductions: **CLEARED**  
- Status for all personnel: **PENDING** (awaiting first punch)
- Earnings: **0**
- Deductions: **0**

## Deduction Calculation Logic

The system calculates deductions in **two ways**:

### 1. Real-time Deduction Records (Database)
Created when events occur:
- **Late Arrival**: Created when user punches in late
- **Early Timeout**: Created when user leaves early
- **Absence**: Created by auto-mark-absent cron job

### 2. Dynamic Calculation (On-the-fly)
Calculated when viewing attendance:
- Based on time-in vs expected time-in
- Based on missing attendance records
- Based on incomplete work hours

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Reset Attendance
1. Go to `/admin/profile?tab=settings`
2. Click "Reset Attendance Data"
3. Enter your admin password
4. Confirm reset
5. **Expected**: "Attendance reset complete! Deleted X attendance records and Y related deductions."

### Test 2: Verify Clean State
1. Go to `/admin/attendance`
2. Switch to "Current Day" view
3. **Expected**: All personnel show PENDING status with 0 deductions
4. Switch to "Personnel" view  
5. **Expected**: All personnel show 0 total deductions

### Test 3: Create New Attendance
1. Go to `/attendance-portal`
2. Punch in (if after time-in end, should calculate late deduction)
3. Go to `/admin/attendance`
4. **Expected**: Should see correct late minutes and deduction amount

### Test 4: Reset Again
1. Reset attendance again from profile settings
2. **Expected**: New deductions should be deleted along with attendance

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/admin/reset/attendance/route.ts`
   - Added deduction cleanup logic
   - Added detailed response with counts

2. `/src/app/admin/profile/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced reset confirmation message
   - Shows deleted counts for attendance reset

3. `/src/app/api/attendance/punch/route.ts`
   - Fixed timezone issue in late deduction calculation
   - Properly handles Philippines timezone for time comparison

4. `ATTENDANCE_RESET_FIX.md` (this file)
   - Complete documentation of the fix

## Status Definitions

After reset, personnel will show these statuses based on their actions:

- **PENDING**: Awaiting time-in (no attendance record yet)
- **PRESENT**: Punched in on time, complete attendance
- **LATE**: Punched in after time-in window end
- **ABSENT**: No punch-in after cutoff time
- **PARTIAL**: Punched in but no punch-out after cutoff
- **ON_LEAVE**: User is on approved leave

## Deduction Types

The system tracks three types of attendance deductions:

1. **Late Arrival** (₱ per second late)
   - Calculated: `(seconds late) × (basic salary / working days / 8 hours / 60 min / 60 sec)`
   - Max: 50% of daily salary

2. **Early Timeout** (₱ per second early)
   - Calculated: `(seconds early) × (basic salary / working days / 8 hours / 60 min / 60 sec)`
   - Max: 50% of daily salary

3. **Absence** (full day deduction)
   - Calculated: `basic salary / working days`
   - Applied: When no time-in by cutoff time

## Notes

- Reset is **irreversible** - all attendance data and deductions are permanently deleted
- Password confirmation required for security
- Only ADMIN users can reset attendance
- Reset clears ALL attendance data, not just current period
- After reset, you can set new attendance settings and personnel can start fresh

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Selective Reset**: Reset only specific date range instead of all data
2. **Backup Before Reset**: Automatic backup of data before deletion
3. **Soft Delete**: Archive data instead of permanent deletion
4. **Audit Trail**: Log who performed reset and when
5. **Reset Confirmation**: Require typing "DELETE" or similar confirmation
